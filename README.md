May 2021: I am creating a Full Stack React/Node app, which will allow me to have while research efficient ways to bring together the FrontEnd and BackEnd.

I am using Nextjs to make the React/Nodejs App somewhat different than usually. Nextjs allows for hot code reloading which is great.

Semantic UI React will help this app tremendously and speed up the development phase of the project.

AWS Cloud Services for deployment.

Node Package Manager

npm init -y has allowed me to create an npm folder with typing in, any of my information.

npm i --save next react react-dom <--- I had installed Next.js and ReactDom router into this application.

May 31st 2021 -->> Added some features that would enhance API Calls from Backend to Frontend. Like npm nprogress.
